A collection of notebooks that teach Python from the top down - introducing language features as they are needed in a real example.

They provide the student with a view of an entire Python program, immersing the student in a big picture and explaining concepts & components as they appear, in the context of using them in the program.

This approach can be directly contrasted with the more common bottom up approach, where language features are introduced out of context.  You can find a collections of notebooks that teach Python from the bottom up in [dsr-classes/basics](https://github.com/stanislav-chekmenev/dsr-classes/tree/master/python/basics).

It is recomended that the notebooks are taught in the following order:
- [using an API](https://github.com/stanislav-chekmenev/dsr-classes/blob/master/python/top-down/using-an-api.ipynb)
    * JSON
    * file read/write (I/O) context management `with open(fi, 'r')`
    * `requests`
- [web scraping](https://github.com/stanislav-chekmenev/dsr-classes/blob/master/python/top-down/web-scraping.ipynb)
    * HTML
    * `bs4`
